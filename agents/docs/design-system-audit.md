# Renderer UI audit

This checklist records the source-wide audit introduced with `@heron/ui` and extended as the
renderer grew. The inventory is now collected dynamically rather than frozen at the original 61
Vue files. On the 2026-07-30 expansion pass, `lint:design` covered 234 renderer sources, 45 UI
sources, and 8 design-system sources. “Reviewed” means the file is covered by the automated
raw-color, typography, token-reference, z-index, overlay, dependency-boundary, and Storybook-only
checks; it does not mean every product-specific DAW control was replaced with a generic primitive.

Product-specific controls were retained where their interaction is intrinsically musical or
two-dimensional. Their colors now come from the domain palette or runtime CSS variables, and
their focus/keyboard semantics remain part of desktop tests.

## UnoCSS migration classification (2026-08-18)

The current 40 `@heron/ui` and 137 Desktop renderer Vue files fall into one of three explicit
ownership groups:

1. **Utility-owned structure.** Ordinary flex/grid layout, spacing, sizing, overflow, typography,
   and simple chrome were migrated in `UiButton`, `UiCheckbox`, `UiDialog`, `UiEmptyState`,
   `UiField`, `UiIconButton`, `UiLoadingState`, `UiNumberInput`, `UiPopover`, `UiProgress`,
   `UiSectionHeading`, `UiSelect`, `UiSpinner`, `UiStatusNotice`, `UiSurface`, `UiTextInput`,
   `UiToolbar`, and `UiTooltip`. Desktop migration covers `AppChrome`, `AppRouteView`, Splash,
   the settings containers, `StudioWorkspace`, `StudioTopbar`, `StudioStatusbar`,
   `ArrangementWorkspace`, and `MixerConsole`.
2. **Scoped domain styling retained.** Mixer controls, faders, meters, rotary/curve controls,
   waveforms, arrangement and piano-roll geometry, timeline/global lanes, menus, gradients,
   pseudo-elements, resize handles, and runtime-positioned elements retain scoped CSS. Partially
   migrated files keep only these stateful or geometric rules after their structural declarations
   moved to utilities.
3. **No local visual ownership.** Route views, hosts, providers, logos, and controller-only
   components without ordinary local layout remain composition/API boundaries and require no
   utility conversion.

This classification applies to every Vue file in the two scanned roots rather than treating a
remaining `<style>` block as unfinished work. `lint:design` scans those roots plus design-system
stories and rejects dynamic utility construction, raw utility colors, numeric utility z-indexes,
and undefined semantic utility tokens.

## Automated gates

- No renderer import from `reka-ui`.
- No manual renderer `Teleport` overlay.
- No Histoire dependency or script.
- No raw renderer color.
- No numeric renderer z-index.
- No undefined shared token reference; the `--ui-` namespace resolves only through shared token
  sources.
- UI package cannot import product state, routing, contracts, Electron, or preload APIs.
- Ordinary UI elevation uses shared tokens; dynamic signal glows are restricted to documented DAW
  domain directories.
