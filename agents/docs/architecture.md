# Architecture and real-time constraints

Heron is an Electron application with one native audio runtime embedded in the
Electron main process.

```text
Vue renderer
  -> typed window.heron preload API
  -> Electron main RPC handlers and application services
  -> @heron/dsp-node (.node dynamic library, same process)
       -> embedded Rust control runtime
       -> audio engine and cpal streams
       -> format-neutral AudioPlugin runtime
            -> VST3 adapter and ARA sidecar
            -> CLAP adapter
       -> direct telemetry and bounded parameter queue
```

There is no `heron-audio-host` executable, audio-host client addon, OS IPC
channel, shared-memory arena, watchdog, or helper restart coordinator. The
renderer/main Electron boundary remains a real process boundary; the
main/native boundary is N-API within one process.

## Ownership

- Renderer owns presentation and user intent. It never imports native addons.
- Preload exposes the narrow typed `window.heron` API.
- Electron main owns resource validation, project state, native runtime
  lifetime, and application policy.
- `@heron/dsp-node` owns `EmbeddedAudioHost`, its bounded Tokio control queues,
  audio engine, AudioPlugin actors, and telemetry.
- The audio callback owns only real-time-safe state. It must not perform N-API,
  Electron IPC, filesystem I/O, allocation, logging, or blocking locks.

## Dependency contracts

The process diagram is also a dependency direction. Imports and runtime calls
must point toward an owned contract, never around it.

```text
renderer presenter <- props / intent -> renderer controller or store
renderer controller or store -> typed preload API -> main IPC handler
main IPC handler -> application service -> project DB and native adapters
native adapter -> @heron/dsp-node -> embedded runtime -> audio callback
```

- Presenters do not read stores, routing, Electron, the project database, or
  `window.heron`.
- Preload adapts the narrow API but owns no application policy or durable state.
- IPC handlers validate, authorize, resolve explicit resources, and delegate;
  application services own workflows and commit points.
- `@heron/contracts` contains serializable boundary types and depends on no UI,
  Electron, persistence, or native implementation.
- `@heron/project-model` owns pure project invariants.
- Mixer invariants and its persistence projection are independent of Studio
  tracks, clips, and musical maps; Studio adds its own ownership and timeline
  validation to the shared Mixer model.
- `@heron/project-db` is the only project persistence implementation.
- `@heron/ui` owns shared visual behavior and accessibility, never product state.

## Stateful workflow contract

A stateful operation that crosses renderer/main or main/native boundaries must
define its states, explicit resource handles, generation/revision behavior,
single commit point, prepare/abort cleanup, failure data state, and idempotency
or operation-status reconciliation. The renderer receives a serializable typed
result and a documented recoverable or quarantined state.

Completion order is not authority. When automatic recovery competes with a
newer user mutation, an explicit generation determines which result may commit.
The implemented device-recovery precedence is recorded in
[ADR-0001](adr/0001-runtime-ownership-and-transactions.md).

Every workflow with these properties includes state-machine or state-table
tests. A timeout must not manufacture a failure response when a dispatched
mutation can still commit.

Project commands read their result inside the SQL transaction. Their retained
response transfers from the database worker to main, then is released after
renderer acknowledgement; results are not indefinitely retained per edit.
Unknown commit outcomes quarantine the graph until an authoritative workspace
is re-established. See [ADR-0001](adr/0001-runtime-ownership-and-transactions.md).

## Native control and UI events

Electron main sends MessagePack request envelopes to the addon to preserve one
typed Rust protocol and one response-validation path. This serialization is a
local N-API ABI, not an IPC transport. Binary payloads are inline; attachment
descriptors and shared-memory references are rejected.

The addon places control work on bounded in-process channels. N-API async tasks
wait outside the JavaScript thread. Parameter automation uses a separate
bounded direct queue, and telemetry is read directly from the engine snapshot.

Plug-in control and editor calls remain thread-affine. Tokio queues them on a
bounded mailbox and wakes Electron main through a non-blocking N-API
threadsafe function. Electron drains at most one bounded batch per turn and
owns the platform application loop; the embedded runtime never creates or
pumps a winit event loop. Electron `BaseWindow` owns each native plug-in editor
surface and a sandboxed `WebContentsView` toolbar; Rust attaches only the
platform child view below that toolbar and returns resize/state requests through
a bounded queue drained by Electron main.

## Audio plug-in formats

`heron-audio-plugin` owns the format-neutral block processor, process context,
events, stable audio-port and parameter keys, and temporary real-time tokens.
`audio-engine` and `dsp-render` depend only on this crate; concrete plug-in
formats must not leak into either render graph.

The control plane identifies a plug-in by `{ format, artifactPath, nativeId }`.
Projects persist opaque state chunks and audio side-chain port keys. Strings are
resolved to bounded numeric tokens before graph publication, so the callback
never performs string lookup. VST3 maps bus and parameter IDs into this model;
CLAP uses its native IDs. ARA remains a VST3-only sidecar.

Project audio modes describe the channel-strip signal contract, independently
of a processor's native bus layout. A proven native 1-in/2-out layout provides
`mono-to-stereo` directly. A processor with only a proven 1-in/1-out layout can
provide the same host mode through an explicit format-neutral post-process
adapter that copies left output to right without callback allocation. Native
layout probing remains isolated; the embedded runtime never retries a layout
that the probe did not validate. See
[ADR-0001](adr/0001-runtime-ownership-and-transactions.md).

`heron-clap-host` is the only owner of CLAP unsafe FFI and depends directly on
the pinned `clap-sys` version. It separates a main-thread, `!Send + !Sync`
control instance from a `Send + !Sync` audio endpoint. Factory probing occurs
in `heron-clap-probe`; live processing remains embedded in Electron main.
Timer callbacks and Unix POSIX-FD readiness are polled from the existing
UI/control heartbeat and never from the audio callback. Restart and parameter
or port rescans publish a temporary processor-less graph, explicitly stop the
old endpoint on the audio thread, wait for its lease to return, reactivate on
the control thread, then publish the replacement endpoint. A failed
reactivation leaves the committed project intact and the live graph bypassed.

### Official plug-in fixture testing

CI pins and builds Steinberg's AGain and Note Expression Synth VST3 examples
and the free-audio headless CLAP example module. Heron's own probes must
enumerate their expected native IDs before the embedded host tests load them.
The VST3 example build also runs Steinberg's validator against both fixtures.
The smoke tests then exercise parameters, state, side-chain configuration,
CLAP note events, graph publication, mock-device processing, and output
metering; the VST3 fixture also runs its native editor under Xvfb.

Upstream plug-in validators complement this flow but do not replace it: a
validator checks whether a plug-in behaves correctly when driven by its own
reference host, while these fixtures check whether Heron behaves correctly as
the host. No upstream fixture binary is checked into the repository.

## Failure model

An unrecoverable native crash terminates the Electron main process; it cannot
leave a live renderer talking to a dead audio helper. Ordinary request errors
remain typed results and do not destroy the runtime. Heartbeats provide
diagnostics only and never trigger graph/plugin/transport reconstruction.

Embedded control requests wait for terminal actor results. Slow-request
thresholds drive logs and diagnostics but never cancel already-dispatched work
or manufacture a timeout result with an unknown mutation outcome.

Runtime worker limits are saved as preferences and applied on the next
application launch. Heron deliberately does not tear down and recreate the
embedded audio runtime in a live process.

Rust production paths return typed `Result` values for device, plug-in,
filesystem, input, and protocol failure. Runtime input is not handled with
`panic!`, `unwrap()`, or unexplained `expect()`. Panic must never unwind through
N-API, a plug-in ABI, a platform callback, or the audio callback. A callback
reports failure through bounded state, counters, or a non-blocking control
signal; it does not recover in place.

## Real-time rules

- Keep callback work bounded and allocation-free.
- Use lock-free snapshots or bounded non-blocking queues at callback edges.
- Build graphs, load plug-ins, access files, and encode responses off callback
  threads.
- Never hold a callback-visible lock across N-API, Electron, device, plug-in,
  or filesystem calls.
- Overflow and stale-generation outcomes must be explicit and observable.

## Decision governance

Changes to process/thread ownership, persistence, cross-process protocols,
real-time assumptions, foundational dependencies, compatibility commitments,
or material Logic interaction semantics require an architecture decision record.
See [ADR governance](adr/README.md). Accepted decisions are reflected back into
this current-state document; proposed decisions are not current architecture.
