# Native call boundary

Only Electron main may import `@heron/dsp-node`. Renderer code calls the typed
preload API exposed as `window.heron`; preload forwards validated operations to
main and never exposes the addon itself.

```text
renderer -> preload -> Electron main -> @heron/dsp-node -> EmbeddedAudioHost
```

The final arrow is a same-process N-API call. `AudioHostRuntime` owns the Rust
runtime and exposes asynchronous control requests, priority heartbeat,
parameter enqueue, direct telemetry, host-event draining, bounded main-thread UI
draining, and explicit close. Control promises are Tokio futures backed by bounded
channels and oneshot terminal replies; they must not occupy a libuv worker with
`blocking_send`, `recv`, or `recv_timeout` while native work is pending.

Potentially blocking engine and device operations run on Tokio's blocking pool.
Actor lanes preserve the ordering required by a resource while isolating that
resource from heartbeat, parameter ingress, background I/O, and unrelated
control requests. Closing the runtime initiates shutdown and reaps the runtime
thread in the background; it must not join the runtime thread from Electron's
main thread.

The MessagePack request/response envelope is retained as a local ABI so Rust
protocol validation stays centralized. It must not grow process-lifecycle,
framing, attachment, shared-memory, lease, or retry semantics. Large state is
carried inline until a measured local-boundary bottleneck justifies a simpler
typed N-API representation.

`AudioHostService` owns one runtime for the application lifetime. Shutdown asks
the runtime to stop, drains ordered host events, settles pending calls, and
closes the addon. Runtime thread settings apply on the next launch rather than
recreating the native runtime in place.

Control requests do not have a semantic deadline after they enter the embedded
runtime. Dropping a waiter cannot cancel actor or third-party plug-in work and
could otherwise report failure before a stateful command commits. Per-command
slow thresholds are diagnostic only: requests are counted and logged when they
cross the threshold while callers continue waiting for a terminal result.
User-visible long operations belong in background-operation UI with explicit
progress or cancellation when the underlying operation supports it.

VST3 controller and editor operations are queued by Tokio and drained in bounded
turns on Electron's main thread. A non-blocking N-API threadsafe-function wake
requests an immediate drain; an unref'd maintenance timer services plug-in and
ARA timers. The embedded runtime must not create or pump a winit event loop,
because Electron already owns the platform application loop.

Electron main creates one `BaseWindow` per native plug-in editor and registers
its platform handle before sending `OpenPluginEditor`. A sandboxed
`WebContentsView` renders the host-owned toolbar at the top of that window;
Rust creates only the native child container and VST3 view below it. Toolbar
A/B, clipboard, undo/redo, and zoom actions use typed asynchronous control
requests. Tokio routes them through the same bounded UI mailbox, so Electron's
request caller never waits synchronously for plug-in state save or restore
work. Drains are bounded between plug-in calls; an individual third-party VST3
call remains thread-affine and cannot be preempted by the host. Plug-in resize
requests return through a bounded native event queue; Electron sizes the parent
window and reports its content bounds back to Rust. Close ordering is strict:
detach the VST3 view, unregister the host surface, then destroy the Electron
window. Pure Wayland is rejected explicitly; X11, AppKit, and Win32 share this
same ownership protocol. The embedded runtime must never lazily create or pump
a second platform event loop as a fallback. The proposed native Wayland and
XWayland compatibility policy is recorded in
[ADR-0006](adr/0006-tier-linux-plug-in-editor-compatibility.md); it is not
current architecture until accepted and implemented.

Do not:

- import the addon from renderer or preload;
- add a second audio client addon or helper executable;
- add OS IPC/shared-memory descriptors to native requests;
- call N-API, Electron, or blocking services from an audio callback;
- turn native failures into free-form cross-process protocol errors.
