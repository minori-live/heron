# Heron Design System

Heron is a dense professional audio workstation. Its interface should feel precise, calm, and
signal-led: large surfaces remain neutral, while color is reserved for focus, primary action,
feedback, recording, MIDI, audio, meters, and other data-bearing states.

The source of truth is `packages/ui`. Storybook in `apps/design-system` is the interactive
reference. Product screens may compose these primitives, but they must not create a second
generic component system.

This document governs visual language, shared components, and accessibility.
[Product interaction design](interaction-design.md) governs workflow, control exposure, Logic
behavioral parity, and feedback placement. Passing token and component checks does not justify
hiding a frequently adjusted parameter in a menu.

## Visual thesis

Heron is built for musicians, editors, and audio engineers who may keep the same workspace open
for hours. The interface's single job is to keep musical position, editable scope, and audio state
legible without competing with the material being edited.

The core palette is intentionally small:

- **Carbon** `#101010` — the two-dimensional musical workspace;
- **Graphite** `#202020` — controls, strips, and local structure;
- **Steel** `#8da8b5` — focus, primary action, and neutral selection;
- **Wave cyan** `#72c3c7` — audio-domain signal;
- **Take red** `#ff6577` — recording and destructive live state;
- **Meter amber** `#e8b75f` — thresholds that need attention.

Interface type uses bundled Inter Variable, restrained headings use Barlow Condensed, and
musical measurements use Cascadia Mono Variable. Families are loaded through `unplugin-fonts`
and Fontsource (`packages/ui/fonts.ts`) so desktop, Storybook, and docs share the same faces.
Desktop and Storybook use Unhead (`useLocaleFonts`) to keep `html lang` aligned with the active
locale and to load Noto Sans SC Variable for Chinese UI; docs rely on VitePress locale `lang`
plus the same `:lang(zh*)` token overrides. A family is a role, not decoration: time, dB, BPM,
ticks, channels, and aligned tables use data type; sentences and controls use interface type.

The signature element is the **signal rail**: a narrow channel-derived edge marks the active clip,
track, route, or editable scope while the surrounding surface remains neutral. It always appears
with a text, shape, or programmatic state, so color is never the only carrier.

## Principles

1. **Signal over decoration.** Color, motion, and elevation explain state or hierarchy.
2. **Dense, not tiny.** Professional density is valuable; illegible text and inaccessible targets
   are not. Generic controls use 32–48 px heights. Specialized DAW controls may use the WCAG
   24×24 px minimum.
3. **Semantic first.** Components consume semantic color, spacing, typography, focus, motion,
   elevation, and layer tokens.
4. **Composition stays in the product.** Views and hosts own stores, routing, and workflows.
   `@heron/ui` owns visual behavior and accessibility.
5. **Accessibility is behavior.** Keyboard operation, focus restoration, live regions, reflow,
   contrast, and reduced motion are tested rather than inferred from appearance.
6. **One interaction, one primitive.** Actions, modes, navigation, selection, and numeric values
   are different behaviors and must not share an improvised button style.
7. **The canvas is exceptional, its chrome is not.** Notes, clips, waveforms, faders, rulers, and
   meters may use domain geometry. Their toolbars, fields, menus, status, and selection controls
   still use `@heron/ui`.

## Package boundary

`@heron/ui` may depend on Vue and Reka UI. It must not depend on Pinia, Vue Router, Electron,
`window.heron`, IPC contracts, the project database, or product stores. Vue is a peer dependency
to prevent multiple runtimes.

Renderer code imports Reka behavior only through `@heron/ui`. A controller host reads stores and
passes serializable props to a presenter. A presenter emits intent; it does not call the preload
API. Storybook product examples render from plain fixtures.

## Tokens

`tokens.css` defines:

- dark and light primitive palettes;
- canvas, surface, text, border, action, feedback, and signal semantics;
- spacing, radius, control size, typography, elevation, focus, motion, and z-index;
- compatibility aliases used by existing DAW styles during source-level migration.

Every `var(--ui-...)` reference must resolve to a declaration in `tokens.css` or
`domain-palette.css`. `lint:design` rejects misspelled and removed tokens. Local runtime variables
use a feature name without the `--ui-` prefix (for example `--clip-color`); the `--ui-` namespace
is reserved for the shared system.

`domain-palette.css` contains fixed product-rendering colors moved out of component styles during
the 61-file audit. These values are allowed only where a DAW visualization needs a stable
spatial or signal distinction: mixer chrome, tracks, clips, waveforms, meters, and plug-in state.
Ordinary forms, overlays, loading states, settings, and navigation use semantic tokens.

Raw colors and numeric z-index values are forbidden outside token sources. Ordinary UI shadows
use the elevation or focus tokens. Domain visualizations may compose a local glow from a semantic
or runtime signal color; this exception is checked and documented by `lint:design`.

Runtime track, waveform, peak, and lane colors must enter through a documented CSS custom
property. Never interpolate a runtime value into a CSS selector or use it as the only carrier of
state.

## Component selection

### Provider

Use `UiProvider` once at the application boundary. It owns text direction, tooltip timing, and
the Reka configuration context. Storybook creates a fresh Pinia per story and wraps every story
with the same provider.

### Actions

- `UiButton` is the default text action. Use `primary` once per decision area, `secondary` for
  normal actions, `ghost` for low-emphasis chrome, and `danger` for destructive commitment.
- `UiIconButton` requires a non-empty `label`. The tooltip supplements, but never replaces, the
  accessible name.
- Loading disables the action, exposes `aria-busy`, and retains the original label so layout and
  intent do not jump.

### Forms

Use `UiField` to associate label, description, error, and required state. Controls use typed
`defineModel`: `UiTextInput`, `UiSelect`, `UiCheckbox`, `UiRadioGroup`, and `UiSlider`.

Validation errors are specific, placed beside the field, and connected with
`aria-describedby`. Do not validate on every keystroke when the user cannot yet provide a
complete value. Disabled controls remain named.

Use `UiNumberInput` for bounded musical and technical values. It exposes spinbutton semantics,
Arrow/Page/Home/End keyboard behavior, and prevents accidental value changes while the containing
workspace scrolls. Use `UiField layout="inline"` only in narrow inspectors; normal settings and
dialogs keep stacked fields.

`UiRotaryControl` is the shared compact DAW primitive for Pan, Send level, and equivalent bounded
continuous parameters. It owns vertical drag, keyboard adjustment, direct numeric editing,
double-click reset, value text, and focus behavior. Product wrappers translate domain values and
emit project preview/commit intent; they must not reimplement the knob geometry or gesture. Pointer
drag is scaled against the parameter's complete range rather than its step count, so fractional dB
steps do not require impractically long travel. `ringWeight="emphasized"` is reserved for compact
controls whose colored progress would otherwise be illegible.

`UiVerticalFader`, `UiDbScale`, and `UiLevelMeter` own the reusable channel-strip geometry and
accessibility contract. The fader prevents track clicks from jumping a value, previews continuously,
commits once, supports Escape cancellation and double-click reset, and exposes formatted value text.
The scale and meter accept plain marks and normalized display values; they do not calculate product
telemetry, read settings, or write project state. Mixer hosts own dB conversion, peak hold and return
behavior, clipping reset, and project command orchestration.

`UiMixerStateButton` is the shared visual and accessibility primitive for Mute, Solo, Record,
Input Monitoring, and equivalent compact Mixer states. It owns tone, active, disabled, joined, and
focus presentation. The product host decides whether a state exists, whether it is available, and
which project command a press emits. Plug-in slots remain product components because their identity,
drag payload, runtime status, and commands depend on plug-in contracts.

### Overlays

- `UiDialog` owns portal placement, overlay, focus trapping and restoration, Escape, outside
  dismissal, reflow, and modal behavior.
- `UiAlertDialog` is only for a decision that interrupts the workflow. Destructive actions name
  the object and consequence.
- Dialog hierarchy is always eyebrow (optional category), short stable action title, contextual
  description, then body content. File names, project names, plug-in names, paths, counts, and
  changing progress phases do not become the dialog title.
- A body section that names the current phase or result uses a real heading at normal reading
  size. Eyebrows label categories or states; they never substitute for the content heading.
- `UiPopover` contains non-modal contextual controls. It is not a small dialog.
- `UiTooltip` contains short supplemental text and optional shortcut notation. It cannot contain
  an essential action.

Product hosts may own queues or stores, but must render these overlay components. Manual
`Teleport`, hand-written modal backdrops, and local overlay z-indexes are forbidden.

### Feedback

- `UiProgress` uses a value for determinate work and `null` for indeterminate work.
- `UiSpinner` is for compact, unknown-duration work.
- `UiLoadingState`, `UiEmptyState`, and `UiStatusNotice` provide complete page or region states.
- Use `aria-live="polite"` for useful asynchronous status. Use an alert only when immediate
  interruption is necessary. Never announce rapidly changing meters.

### Structure

`UiSurface` and `UiSectionHeading` create stable visual hierarchy without business behavior.
They should remain inexpensive to nest and must not read application state.

### Workspace commands and selection

- `UiToolbar` is the semantic command surface for an editor or dock. It has a required accessible
  label, fixed start/end areas, and a locally scrollable command area.
- `UiSegmentedControl` is for one exclusive mode in a stable set, such as Select, Draw, or Erase.
  It is not navigation and does not switch documents or panels.
- `UiChoiceChip` selects one peer object such as an editable clip. Its signal rail may accept a
  documented runtime color, but text and `aria-pressed` carry the same state.
- A zoom pair is an action group, not a segmented control. A panel switch is navigation, not a
  pressed action, unless the same control directly opens and closes that panel.

## Density and spatial composition

There are two density contexts:

- **Standard** is the default for welcome, settings, dialogs, onboarding, and long-running
  workflows. Controls are 32–48 CSS px high and use the rem-based type scale.
- **Compact** is reserved for persistent DAW chrome inside a musical workspace. Controls remain at
  least 24×24 CSS px, use dense role typography, and must expose their full accessible name.

Do not make a standard workflow compact merely to fit more content. Do not make clips, mixer
strips, or rulers standard-density when that would reduce visible musical context.

The application shell follows one spatial grammar:

```text
┌ application menu / project identity ─────────────────────────┐
├ global transport and monitoring commands ────────────────────┤
├ track inspector ┆ primary musical canvas ┆ notes or media ───┤
├─────────┴ optional editor or mixer dock ┴─────────────────────┤
└ engine, device, position, and operation status ───────────────┘
```

The left panel contains the contextual track inspector, including track properties and the
complete track-specific MIDI input route. Notes and the project Media Browser are mutually
exclusive views of the resizable right panel. Mixer controls and plug-in selection remain in the
Mixer.

Only the musical canvas and dock may scroll in two dimensions. Toolbars, inspectors, modal
content, and global status never rely on horizontal page scrolling. Resizers are separators with
an accessible name and keyboard equivalent; a pointer gesture cannot be the only way to restore
or close a region.

## Interaction states

Every interactive component defines the applicable states in this order: default, hover, focus,
pressed, selected, disabled, busy, invalid. Focus is never replaced by selected styling. Selected
means the object or mode remains current after activation; pressed means the pointer or key is
currently actuating the control. Busy disables duplicate commitment but preserves the action
label. Invalid names the recovery beside the field.

## Product patterns

### Loading and long-running operations

Keep the operation title stable, describe the current phase, show determinate progress when
known, and expose cancellation only when the operation is actually cancellable. A completed or
failed operation may be dismissed; a non-cancellable running operation may not.

### Empty and error states

An empty state explains what is absent and offers the most likely next action. An error explains
what failed, whether data is safe, and a recovery action. Avoid error codes as the primary copy.

### Destructive confirmation

The title names the action (“Delete channel?”). The description names the object and states the
irreversible consequence. The destructive button repeats the verb; the safe action is plainly
“Cancel”.

### Two-dimensional workspaces

Arrangement and mixer canvases may scroll locally in two dimensions. Their heading, description,
toolbars, context controls, and overlays still reflow at 320 CSS px and remain operable at 200%
text zoom. Scrolling the canvas must not hide the only way to leave or configure it.

An editor toolbar uses `UiToolbar`; exclusive tools use `UiSegmentedControl`; open editable
objects use `UiChoiceChip`; bounded inspector values use `UiNumberInput`. This is the required
baseline for arrangement, piano-roll, automation, sampler, and future score editors.

## Content

Use sentence case. Prefer a concrete verb (“Import four tracks”) to a generic label (“OK”).
Status copy states the object and outcome. Short labels may use DAW-standard terms such as dB,
BPM, MIDI, ASIO, and VST3; unfamiliar technical details belong in supporting text.

## Accessibility

WCAG 2.2 AA is the release floor:

- visible focus for every operable element;
- programmatic name, role, value, and state;
- at least 24×24 CSS px targets for dense specialized controls;
- text and UI contrast that meets AA in dark and light themes;
- full keyboard operation without a pointer-only gesture;
- focus trap and restoration for modal overlays;
- 320 CSS px reflow for non-canvas content and 200% text zoom;
- reduced-motion support;
- no information conveyed by color alone.
- exclusive mode groups support arrow-key roving focus;
- numeric fields expose min, max, current value, and keyboard stepping.

Every Storybook story runs Axe with `parameters.a11y.test = "error"`. Complex behavior also has a
`play` test. Critical dark/light product examples are the review surfaces for manual visual checks.

## Storybook

Run:

```sh
pnpm design:dev
pnpm design:build
pnpm design:test
pnpm lint:design
```

Storybook is local and CI-only. It is never deployed and is not included in Electron packaging.
Stories are CSF TypeScript. Principles and foundations are MDX. Autodocs provides API reference;
hand-written stories still explain behavior, boundaries, failure states, long text, keyboard
interaction, and dark/light themes.

The toolbar disables motion by default for deterministic interaction and reflow checks. Choose
**Motion enabled** only for a motion-specific review.

Storybook browser tests plus the controls, menus, and reflow Playwright tests run in CI via
`pnpm design:test`.

## Contribution checklist

- Choose an existing primitive before creating a new generic component.
- Keep stores, routing, contracts, and preload calls outside `@heron/ui`.
- Use semantic tokens; justify any domain palette or runtime signal color.
- Keep every `--ui-` reference resolvable from the shared token sources.
- Cover default, disabled/loading/error as applicable, long text, both themes, and keyboard state.
- Add a `play` test for multi-step behavior.
- Confirm focus, Escape, dismissal, and restoration for overlays.
- Confirm 320 px reflow and 200% text zoom for non-canvas UI.
- Run `pnpm lint:design`, UI tests, Storybook tests, and the static Storybook build.
