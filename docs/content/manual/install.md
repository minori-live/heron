# Install Heron

Heron publishes installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux with each tagged
release.

## Download a release

1. Open [Heron Releases](https://github.com/minori-live/heron/releases).
2. Choose the newest release and expand **Assets**.
3. Download the file for your system:
   - **Windows x64:** `.exe`
   - **macOS Apple silicon or Intel:** universal `.dmg`
   - **Linux x64 or arm64:** `.AppImage`
4. Keep the accompanying `SHA256SUMS` file if you want to verify the download.

If you have Heron 0.5.1 or earlier, install the first release using the new
update feed manually. Those versions look for update metadata in GitHub Release
assets; newer releases provide it through the Heron website instead. Automatic
updates resume after that installation.

::: tip No release listed?
Heron is experimental. If the Releases page has no published installer yet,
you can build it from source by following the
[development environment guide](https://github.com/minori-live/heron/blob/main/agents/docs/environment.md).
That process is intended for contributors.
:::

## Windows

Run the downloaded installer. Windows audio builds include ASIO® support. For
low-latency work, install the 64-bit ASIO driver supplied by your audio-interface
manufacturer before opening Heron.

If Windows warns about an unrecognized application, confirm that the download
came from the official repository and verify its checksum before continuing.

## macOS

Open the `.dmg` and move Heron to Applications. The first launch may require
confirmation in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, especially for an
experimental or unsigned build.

Allow microphone access when macOS asks; Heron needs that permission to record
from audio inputs.

## Linux

Make the AppImage executable, then run it:

```sh
chmod +x Heron-*.AppImage
./Heron-*.AppImage
```

Your desktop audio configuration determines which devices are available. Make
sure the user running Heron can access the selected device.

## First launch

Heron scans the system and user VST® 3 locations, starts its isolated audio
services, and opens the project workspace. A large plug-in collection can make
the first scan take longer than later launches.

Continue with [Your first project](first-project.md).
