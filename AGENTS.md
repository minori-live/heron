# Agent Guide

This file is the entry point for AI agents and automation working in this
repository. Keep project and agent-facing documentation under `agents/docs/`,
the VitePress website and user manual under `docs/`, and reusable agent skills
under `.agents/skills/`.

## Project Shape

- Product: experimental cross-platform desktop digital audio workstation
  (DAW).
- Desktop application: Electron with separate main, preload, and Vue renderer
  bundles built by repository-owned Vite configurations.
- Frontend: Vue 3, TypeScript, Pinia, Vue Router, Reka UI, Vitest, and
  Playwright.
- Native audio: Rust workspace with `dsp-core` for runtime-agnostic DSP and
  `dsp-node` for the napi-rs addon loaded directly by Electron's main process.
  The addon owns the embedded audio runtime, cpal device streams, plug-in host,
  telemetry, and bounded control queues. There is no audio helper process.
- Windows native builds must always include cpal's ASIO backend. Do not
  introduce an ASIO-free Windows build variant; Windows build hosts must provide
  LLVM/Clang, and runtime validation requires a 64-bit ASIO driver.
- Shared packages: serializable IPC contracts, reusable Vue UI primitives, and
  a PGlite/Drizzle project database.
- Process boundary: the renderer uses the narrow typed preload API exposed as
  `window.heron`; it must never import the native `.node` addon directly.
- Renderer/main cross-process calls use explicit resource handles and serializable
  success/error unions. Stateful mutations require one commit point,
  prepare/abort cleanup, idempotency or operation-status reconciliation, and a
  documented recoverable or quarantined failure state. Do not use exceptions,
  rejected Promises, Rust panics, ambient "current" resources, or free-form
  error strings as cross-process protocol semantics.
- Real-time boundary: keep Electron IPC, UI work, filesystem access, allocation,
  and blocking synchronization out of audio callbacks.
- Native boundary: Electron main may call `@heron/dsp-node`; preload and renderer
  must not import it. The local MessagePack request envelope is a N-API ABI, not
  an inter-process transport. Do not add process supervision, OS shared memory,
  or helper restart/reconciliation around the embedded runtime.
- Runtime management: `mise` with locked Node.js, pnpm, Rust, and APM versions
  in `mise.toml` and `mise.lock`; pnpm manages the JavaScript monorepo.
- Prefer TypeScript for hand-authored Node.js scripts and tool configuration.
  Run erasable TypeScript directly with the locked Node.js 26 runtime and check
  it with a dedicated `tsconfig` using `erasableSyntaxOnly`. Reserve `.mjs` and
  `.cjs` for generated files or bundle outputs whose consumers require those
  extensions.
- Treat 800 lines in a hand-authored production source file as a review trigger,
  and 1200 lines as a hard split threshold. New production files must not enter
  above 800 lines. Tests, generated sources, ABI declarations, and derived FFI
  may be reviewed exceptions. Keep binary entry points, package barrels, route
  views, and application composition roots thin; split by feature and ownership
  boundary rather than by arbitrary type categories. See
  `agents/docs/engineering-standards.md`.
- Treat Logic Pro as the default behavior reference for Mixer, channel-strip,
  routing, Send, plug-in-slot, and parameter gestures. Material deviations need
  a documented decision. See `agents/docs/interaction-design.md`.
- Create an ADR for changes to process/thread boundaries, persistence, cross-
  process protocols, real-time assumptions, foundational dependencies,
  compatibility commitments, or material interaction semantics.

## Common Commands

Use the project-managed toolchain:

```sh
mise install
mise run dev
mise run docs
mise run check
mise run check-fast
mise run build
mise run docs-build
mise run format
mise run format-check
mise run lint
```

`mise run check` is the full validation path: Oxfmt, Oxlint, residual Vue
ESLint, Rust formatting, Clippy, tests, real-time allocation invariants,
benchmark compilation, napi-rs builds, TypeScript checks, Vue unit tests, and
project-database integration tests. `mise run format` applies Oxfmt and
rustfmt; `mise run format-check` and `mise run lint` provide the corresponding
non-mutating checks.

Always run project commands from a login shell so its normal startup files
activate the repository-managed Node.js, pnpm, Rust, and APM versions. On
Windows, use PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`), not Windows PowerShell 5.1
(`powershell.exe`).

```sh
mise run check
cargo --version
pnpm --version
```

Use package-level scripts for narrower validation when appropriate:

```sh
pnpm --filter @heron/desktop test:unit
pnpm --filter @heron/project-db test:integration
mise run test:e2e
cargo xtask test
pnpm format:check
pnpm lint
```

## Documentation Boundary

Keep repository-wide agent instructions in `AGENTS.md`. The `docs/` workspace
is the public VitePress website: keep its content focused on the product landing
page and end-user manual. Place architecture, roadmap, performance, CI,
design-system, development-environment notes, agent workflows, permission
guidance, and implementation checklists under `agents/docs/`. Treat
`.agents/skills/` as APM-managed content derived from `apm.yml` and
`apm.lock.yaml`; update the dependency declarations instead of hand-editing
installed skill copies. Do not place temporary agent notes, generated output,
or benchmark artifacts in either documentation directory.
