**From sketch to stage.**

Heron Studio is a free and open-source digital audio workstation for creating,
recording, and performing music. It aims to provide a fast, dependable creative
environment across Windows, macOS, and Linux—one that can follow an idea from
its first sketch to a finished production or a live stage.

Heron is currently experimental and under active development. It is not yet
recommended for production sessions or live performances.

## Vision

Music-making should not require choosing between creative freedom, technical
control, and reliable performance. Heron's long-term vision is a single,
coherent workspace that serves:

- **Composition and production** — arranging audio and MIDI, shaping sounds,
  automating ideas, and moving quickly from sketch to full arrangement.
- **Recording and mixing** — capturing performances with low latency, editing
  non-destructively, routing signals flexibly, and delivering a finished mix.
- **Live performance** — preparing material in the studio and bringing the same
  instruments, effects, routing, and musical ideas to the stage.

These workflows should reinforce one another through shared Mixer semantics and
an explicit Studio-to-Live path instead of becoming unrelated products.

## Project goals

- **High and predictable performance.** Keep the audio path low-latency,
  real-time safe, and stable as sessions grow.
- **A genuinely cross-platform experience.** Make the same core workflow and
  project available on Windows, macOS, and Linux while integrating well with
  each platform's audio system.
- **Freedom and user ownership.** Keep Heron free software, keep creative work
  under the user's control, and avoid making a service account or subscription
  a prerequisite for making music.
- **Interoperability.** Work with established plug-in ecosystems, audio and MIDI
  hardware, and common media formats rather than creating a closed island.
- **An approachable workflow with room to grow.** Support direct,
  discoverable creation without hiding the routing, timing, and processing
  control needed for demanding work.
- **Reliability from studio to stage.** Treat project integrity, recovery,
  diagnostics, and graceful handling of device or plug-in failures as product
  features.
- **A community-shaped tool.** Develop in the open so musicians, engineers,
  performers, and developers can inspect it, adapt it, and influence its
  direction.

## Current direction

The foundation is in place: a native real-time audio engine with ASIO® support
on Windows, project persistence, arrangement and mixer workflows, audio
recording, MIDI clips, and VST® 3 hosting. The current product focus is a
complete Live performance path for singer-songwriters and livestream performers:
familiar Mixer interaction, external control, visible system health, device
recovery, and verified two-hour stability on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Studio
to Stage follows with standalone `.hrl` Live documents, hierarchical Set/Patch
authoring, project-owned controls, and a declarative performance UI. Studio
creation completion follows that Live project milestone. Large plug-in-format
and built-in-rack expansions remain backlog work unless they block that user
path.

Until 1.0, project formats and compatibility may change without a migration
guarantee. See the [roadmap](agents/docs/roadmap.md) for milestones and priorities.

## User manual

The [Heron user manual](https://heron.minori.live/manual/) covers installation,
projects, recording, MIDI editing, mixing, plug-ins, audio-device setup, and
troubleshooting.

## Development

The repository uses a locked, project-managed toolchain. To start a development
build:

```sh
mise install
mise run dev
```

Run `mise run docs` to develop the VitePress website locally.
